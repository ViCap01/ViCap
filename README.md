## New Task: Video Interactive Captioning with Human Prompts (ViCap)

As a video clip often includes rich content and semantic details, different people may be interested in different views. Thus a caption generated by an existing video captioning method always fails to meet the ad hoc expectations. We propose a new task called **Video Interactive Captioning (ViCap)**, i.e., when the initial caption generated by a captioning agent does not meet human expectation, we could launch a round of interaction between a human and the agent and give a short prompt to the agent. Then the agent could generate a more accurate caption based on the prompt.
